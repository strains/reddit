# Where to Buy the Best Black Widow Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, check it, we talking 'bout Black Widow, straight up a heavy hitter in the Mary Jane game, packing a mean punch with THC levels soaring past 24%. This ain't no average ganja, it sits among the top-shelf, strongest ever known strains, ain't no cap.

Black Widow's genetics are steeped in sativa, with a 30:70 sativa to indica ratio, gifting you a brain-tingling, cerebral high. It takes you for a ride, bro, like a roller coaster of intense euphoria, a rush of happiness, and a deep relaxation that got you feeling like you're floating on cloud 9. Ain't no joke, it's also got you raiding the fridge, 'cause the munchies with this strain are real.

This ain't no bud for the newbie tokers, though. Black Widow is potent, and she ain't playing. Novices might get a lil' shook, maybe even spark a panic attack. But for those seasoned smokers who can handle her venom, she's a blessing for depression, physical pain, muscle spasms, headaches, and stress. Perfect for sparking up an appetite in folks struggling with eating too, real talk.

You'd think Black Widow's related to White Widow, but nah, they more like cousins or siblings, both popping from the same unknown Brazilian sativa and a South Indian indica. Be ready for dry mouth and red eyes though, and maybe keep the aspirin on deck for potential dizziness or headaches.

Now, when it comes to growing this beauty, Black Widow ain't no diva. Even the greenest growers can cultivate this strain with a bit of know-how. It's a tough plant, resistant to pests, molds, and mildew. Just be cautious with rain, 'cause too much water can mess up your yield. Best to keep her indoors or in a greenhouse.

Don't expect Black Widow to sprout overnight though, she takes her sweet time. But she's worth the wait, trust. Two known phenotypes out there, one short and fast, the other tall and slow. The buds? Straight fire. Deep purple, almost black, like licorice candies dusted in frost, with vibrant orange hairs. Expect her to start flowering between 8 to 10 weeks if you're growing indoors.

As for the yield, indoors you're looking at a nice 12 to 16 ounces per plant, typically around 14 ounces. And she's compact, maxing out at 3 feet, perfect for your inside setup. If you're growing outdoors, you can expect about 11 to 14 ounces per plant. Just remember, outdoors she can reach up to 6 feet, so make sure you've got the space.
