# Where to Buy the Best AK-47 Cannabis Seeds Online

Yo, peep game on the AK-47, y'know, that "AK", "AK47", or "AK 47" joint. This bangin' bud is a bit more sativa-heavy, mixin' up a potpourri of Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani strains, no cap.

This notorious nugget's got a rep for its cerebral one-two punch, leavin' you floatin' in that headspace for hours, homie. The high hits the moment you exhale that good-good, kickstartin' a brain boost that lifts your spirit, and floods you with a wave of vibey euphoria.

Convo's flow smooth as butter while your mind is soarin' higher than the clouds, and your body is just chillin', vibin' in a cozy state of relaxation. With a THC level hittin' between 13-20%, and barely any CBD in the mix, folks dealing with chronic stress, anxiety, depression, or enduring those relentless aches and pains, often pick AK-47 to lighten their load.

The flavor of this bud? It's a tantalizing mix of sour-sweet, floral earthiness with a hint of spice kickin' up on the exhale, gettin' more intense as you keep on puffin'. The aroma don't stray too far from the taste, rockin' an earthy, herbal vibe with a dash of floral spice. The AK-47 nugs? They're oversized, spade-shaped, and minty green with a gang of thick orange hairs and a glaze of frosty amber crystal trichomes.

Thinkin' about growin' some AK-47 in your crib? Word, this skunky, resinous, sativa-leaning hybrid grows best indoors, either with a hydroponic setup or some good ol' soil. It's the most straightforward way to get AK-47 poppin' in your spot. Outdoor cultivation is cool too, but it's for the more experienced green thumbs out there.

AK-47 is a sturdy strain, but keep it ðŸ’¯, it's got a weak spot for rot and mold. So, if you're growin' indoors, you gotta make sure your spot's got good ventilation to avoid dampness that could ruin your crop. Your plants need cool, sunny vibes with plenty of fresh air, and enough vertical space to stretch and reach their full potential.

Indoor growin' (which is the best bet) means you'll be seein' flowers in about 7-9 weeks, and each plant is gonna yield 'bout 14 ounces per square meter. These compact, feminized plants grow 'bout 19 to 32 inches tall. If you're cultivatin' AK-47 outdoors, you'll be harvestin' around the end of October, which is its prime time. Each one of these plants can give you 'bout 14 ounces of top-quality cannabis.
