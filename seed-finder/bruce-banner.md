# Where to Buy the Best Bruce Banner Cannabis Seeds Online

Yo, peep this homie, we talkin' 'bout that Bruce Banner, straight comic book legend status, this green could chill the Incredible Hulk down to a chillin' Joe. This green got that laid-back vibe, but don't sleep on it, it's sativa-dominant DNA (60:40 sativa/indica split) be packin' a heavyweight punch of THC, hittin' up to 29% in some tests. That's like the holy grail for those homies lookin' for the most potent high.

Now, CBD ain't high on this one, so if that's your jam, this ain't your strain. But the head high? Damn, son, it's all euphoria, creative vibes, and full-body mood elevation. Energy levels be up, making this the perfect daytime blaze. Bruce Banner ain't just about the good times though, it's also a killer pain reliever, and it's good for anxiety, depression, nausea, and even insomnia.

You gotta watch out for that dry mouth and them red eyes though, and sometimes you might catch a little paranoia or dizziness. Flavor-wise, this strain is straight sweetness, with hints of citrus, and a strong, pungent aroma that lets you know it's there. The bud is frosty like a winter's day, all thanks to a thick layer of resinous glands.

This strain's been gaining clout thanks to its high THC concentrations. Named Bruce Banner for its massive yields and high potency, these plants are hella tough, flourishing in both indoor and outdoor settings. But let me tell you, if you growin' this outdoors, it's got a loud scent, so if you don't want your whole block knowin' your business, plan accordingly.

A lot of growers use the Screen of Green (scrogging) technique with Bruce Banner to help distribute light when growing indoors. This strain can handle the stress, often producing even higher yields. Inside, Bruce Banner starts flowering around 8 to 9 weeks, and under the right conditions, you could be looking at about 14 ounces per plant. These indoor plants usually top out around 4.5 feet.

Outdoor grows, though? These plants become beasts, hitting up to 10 feet in height and yielding as high as 19 ounces per plant. You gotta harvest these bad girls in early October. Just a heads up though, Bruce Banner ain't the easiest to grow, so it's best if you got some experience in your corner.
