# Where to Buy the Best Orange Bud Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, so check it, we talkin' 'bout this bossed up strain, right? It's called Orange Bud, nothin' but pure fire. It's got that 65:35 indica-sativa split, lettin' you know it's more about that chill vibe than a straight up head trip. The genetics? All Orange, baby, so it's layin' down a taste and scent combo of citrus, cloves, and mint that's straight fire. The buds themselves? Coated in a blaze of bright orange hairs, like they been kissed by the sun, right in line with the flavor and fragrance.

Now, the THC ain't the highest you ever gonna find. We talkin' about a peak at around 16%, so it ain't gonna knock you on your ass, but it ain't no lightweight, neither. CBD, though? That's sittin' low at about 0.3%, so don't be thinkin' this is the strain you need for seizures or other CBD-responsive conditions.

The high you get from this? Man, it's a blend of head and body, mixin' relaxation and joy with a big hit of euphoria. It's got a bit of a pep, too, givin' you some energy and sparkin' your creativity. And when it comes to medicinal use, Orange Bud is straight up legit for chronic pain and anxiety, plus it's got your back on nausea and insomnia. You might get a case of the cottonmouth, though, and dry eyes ain't uncommon. Paranoia and headaches? Those are more rare side effects, no big deal.

This strain's history? It's got roots in Amsterdam in the 80s, a lovechild of two unknown Skunk varieties. But now it's got a foothold here in the U.S., and more and more folks are startin' to grow it. Why? 'Cause it's moderate to grow and works well for both newbies and seasoned cultivators. It thrives both inside and out, and stays pretty compact, not growin' more than about 3.5 feet tall.

If you're growin' indoors, you're lookin' at a yield of 'bout 14 ounces per square meter. Outdoors? Same yield per plant. Flowering time for indoor growers is around 8 to 9 weeks, while those growin' outdoors can expect to harvest in early October. Most folks swear by the 'Sea of Green' cultivation method for maximizin' yield from this Orange Bud crop. So there you have it, a full rundown on the Orange Bud. Roll it, light it, and enjoy the ride.
