# Where to Buy the Best Gorilla Glue #4 Cannabis Seeds Online

Ayy, lemme put y'all up on game 'bout this here Gorilla Glue #4, aka "Original Glue", "Gorilla Glue", or "GG#4". This here's a slight indica-leaning mix (60% indica/40% sativa) stirred up from the notorious Chem's Sister, Sour Dubb, and Chocolate Diesel. This big shot is a top pick for the medicating crowd and plant whisperers across the globe, got that super strong blast and marathon high that'll lay you flat.

This high ain't no sucker punch, naw, it creeps up on you, gradually filling your dome with this uplifted bliss and a dash of creative juice. As your thoughts rise higher, you gon' feel like you stuck in a sticky trap of happiness, ain't got no worries left. This sensation gonna spread through your body 'til you're stone-cold couch-locked, can't move a muscle for a good long while.

Ain't no joke, with these hefty effects and that serious THC level clocking in between 18-32%, folks say GG#4 is just the ticket for handling ADD or ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, chronic pain, depression, chronic fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite, nausea, and migraines. This bud got a spicy, chemical chocolate flavor with a heavy diesel exhale that turns a touch sweeter the more you puff. The scent's along the same lines, but with a sharp pepper note to it.

These Gorilla Glue #4 nugs are small, rounded, and forest green, decked out in fuzzy amber hairs, with a frost of tiny amber-hinted white crystal trichomes that are slick with sweet, sticky resin. It's a solid choice for the green-thumb crowd, whether you're a newbie or an old hand. It's got a strong resistance to disease, making it a breeze to grow outdoors, long as the weather's right. If you're growing outside, you want a warm, dry spot with no wild swings in weather.

But real talk, Gorilla Glue seeds are a dream come true for indoor growers. On average, it's about 8 to 9 weeks to flower, and you can bank on up to 18 ounces of bud per plant. If you let it flower a couple more weeks outside, you can even boost that yield to 21 ounces per plant. So, there you have it, GG#4, a real game-changer.
