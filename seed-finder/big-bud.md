# Where to Buy the Best Big Bud Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, let me spit some knowledge 'bout this heavyweight champ, Big Bud. This indica beast, leanin' 85% on the chill side, snatched up the top spot in the '89 High Times Cannabis Cup. Big Bud ain't just a cool name, fam. This monster's got some seriously swole buds and crazy yields, letting all them cultivators stack mad green. With a THC level that'll knock you on your ass, between 23-26%, Big Bud ain't playin'.

Now, the original Big Bud was a mix of that super dope Afghani and the classic Skunk #1. But since then, this strain's been mixed and remixed with all kinds of other fire to create different vibes and intensities. Big Bud's nugs are long, dense and shaped like a spade, rockin' an olive green color with slick purple undertones. It's got these wild orange hairs that pop out like fireworks, and a crisp layer of white crystal trichomes that look like fresh snow on a winter mornin'.

When it comes to aroma, Big Bud's got that sweet and spicy earth scent that'll have your nose tinglin'. And when you light it up, you get that same earthy flavor, but with a subtle hint of grape on the back end. Now, the Big Bud high, it's slow and steady, but when it hits, it hits hard. We talkin' 'bout a couch-lock so intense, you'll be on a one-way trip to Slumberland. But it ain't all about that sleepy vibe, Big Bud's got that euphoria that'll have you feelin' all kinds of good before it tucks you in for the night.

This is the perfect strain for anyone who's dealing with insomnia or chronic pain. It's like a warm, fuzzy blanket that wraps you up and eases you into a deep, peaceful sleep. Big Bud can grow indoors or outdoors, but if you're looking for maximum height, better have it basking under that natural sunlight. This strain can shoot up to over 5 feet if you let it stretch its legs. Some of the pro growers suggest a hydroponic setup indoors to really bulk up those buds and stalks.

If you're growing Big Bud indoors, expect a yield of 16 to 20 ounces per plant, and they'll be in full bloom between 7 to 9 weeks. Keep an eye on those heavy branches though, they might need some extra support to avoid snapping or bending under the weight of those massive flowers. Now, if you're growing outdoors, Big Bud loves that sunny, Mediterranean vibe, and will reward you with a yield of about 25 ounces or more per plant. Harvest time is around October.

Big Bud is a high-yielding beast, loved by home and commercial growers alike. It's got some of the biggest flowers you'll see on the market, and this indica strain is all bud, very little leaf. If you're looking for a strain that's all about that productivity, ain't nothing touching Big Bud, ya heard?
