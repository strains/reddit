# Where to Buy the Best Crystal Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, let's chop it up 'bout this boss level strain named Crystal. Y'know, she's birthed from two legendary parents, White Widow and Northern Lights, creating some next-level hybrid type of ganja. This shorty takes about nine weeks to flower, but trust me, she's worth the wait.

Indoors, she'll bless you with around 150g, but if you let her breathe in the great outdoors, you could be looking at a hefty 700g. She ain't no tiny thing either, stretching up to about 200cm. Crystal ain't just her name, it's her game too. She got these big, sticky buds all sparklin' with crystals, looking like she's wearing diamond-studded fur with some red highlights.

Now, when it comes to THC, this lady ain't playing. She's packing a powerful punch that'll have your head spinning. Crystal rolls off a smooth smoke that'll have you feeling cerebral vibes like no other. Don't rush it though, she takes a minute to hit, but when she does, you'll be soaring high.

She got this sweet aroma that'll have you thinking of a pine forest. The taste is mad smooth, with a sweet note that'll have you coming back for more. Crystal got the power to chill you out, making her the perfect antidote for stress. She's also good for those dealing with anxiety and depression, giving them a little relief from their symptoms. And if you're struggling with appetite or minor pains, Crystal's got your back.

Now, let's talk about growing this queen. Crystal ain't picky, she'll grow indoors or outdoors, but you gotta keep her trimmed to keep her looking good. Inside, she'll grow about 3 feet high, sporting green leaves and dense buds that shine like her name suggests. If you do it right, you could be looking at a THC level of 25%.

Outdoors, she loves that sunny, subtropical weather. Given the space, she can stretch out and grow almost 10 feet high. Whether you grow her in soil or hydroponics, she's gonna thrive, especially if you use the Sea of Green (SOG) method. She's a vigorous grower, so you'll have to keep her in check with some trimming. Indoors, she'll be ready to harvest in about 8 to 10 weeks, giving you around 14 oz per plant. But if you grow her outdoors, you could be looking at around 16 oz per plant, ready to harvest between late-September and early-October. Trust, Crystal is the strain you wanna get to know.
