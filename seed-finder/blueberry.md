# Where to Buy the Best Blueberry Cannabis Seeds Online

Yo, step into the world of the Blueberry, a heavyweight indica hybrid dominatin' the scene with a strong 80% indica, 20% sativa mix. This magical green came into existence back in the day, round the 70's, all thanks to the mastermind DJ Short. My man was experimenting with different landrace strains, leading him to create this smokin' good masterpiece.

This strain has been turning heads since day one, snatching the 2000 Best Indica award at the High Times' Cannabis Cup. Its killer effects and the irresistible blueberry vanilla flavor put it right at the top.

Blueberry's high ain't no joke, it slides up on you slow, then washes over you with a wave of chill and relaxation. As the high intensifies, your mind gets lost in a hazy daydream, chasing away any negative vibes and numbing your brain. With its chillin' effects and a THC level that can reach up to 24%, Blueberry's perfect for dealing with issues like chronic fatigue, depression, migraines, and all sorts of stress and anxiety.

Aesthetically, this bud is a stunner. It's got grape-shaped, olive green nugs with a hint of electric blue, fiery orange hairs, and a thick frosty layer of tiny amber-colored crystal trichomes. The smell mirrors the taste, offering a spicy yet sweet earthy vanilla aroma, complimented by fragrant floral undertones.

Growin' these Blueberry seeds, you get these dope, fat plants, showin' off with purple, red, and blue shades. But watch out, these plants ain't shy, they spread out wide and require plenty of space to strut their stuff. For most green thumbs, growing Blueberry indoors is the way to go, it gives you more control over their environment and leads to better success. But if you do decide to grow these bad girls outside, they'll thrive as long as they're basking in the sun and breathing in plenty of fresh air.

When grown indoors, Blueberry is a fast bloomer, usually taking about 9 weeks to flower. By harvest time, you're looking at around 18 ounces of usable green per plant. But remember, they need space to reach their full potential. Outdoor yields can be even higher, given the right conditions. If you're blessed with mild winters and plenty of sunlight, you could harvest nearly 25 ounces per plant around mid-October. So, if you're ready to dive into the world of Blueberry, strap in and enjoy the ride, fam!
