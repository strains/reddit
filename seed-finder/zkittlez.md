# Where to Buy the Best Zkittlez Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, let's chop it up about this fire Zkittlez, a real heavyweight indica-dominant hybrid. This flame was forged by cross-pollinating the mightily delicious Grape Ape and Grapefruit strains. Now, the indica-sativa ratio, it's got some flex depending on how the breeders be doing their thing, but it's been clocked on the reg with a relatively chill THC level of about 15%.

Even with that easygoing THC level, this bud ain't no lightweight, nah, it scooped the gold for Best Indica at both the 2015 Cannabis Cups in the Bay and the Mitten State. Don't let the lower THC content fool ya, 'cause this bud slaps with a potent flavor profile that'll make you think you tasting the rainbow.

Zkittlez got a wicked fruity aroma, like a tropical paradise mixed with some sweet earthy goodness, and it got this slight herbal vibe to it, ya feel? The taste is where it's at though, it's got this sweet berry flavor that's rounded off with a crisp tropical citrus aftertaste that sticks to your tongue long after you've finished chiefing.

The high from Zkittlez is as tempting as its taste. It's a mellow vibe that starts with a head rush that leaves you feeling happy as hell and sparking with creativity, but you ain't gonna be feeling anxious or overwhelmed. You'll be followed by a chill body high that creeps from head to toe, leaving you relaxed and pain-free but you still got full control of your movements. As you start to come down, you'll feel a gentle wave of sleepiness but it ain't gonna knock you out.

This makes Zkittlez the ideal choice for those suffering from insomnia, chronic pain, mild depression, chronic stress or anxiety, and inflammation. The bud itself is a beauty - big and chunky pepper-shaped nugs in dark olive green with sparse rich amber hairs and a thick frosty layer of tiny white crystal trichomes.

Zkittlez is a real show of its parent strains. The sativa side likes it hot and humid, but if you wanna see its purple side, you gotta give it some cool vibes from its indica genetics. Just don't go below 50 degrees Fahrenheit or you'll have some trouble. Zkittlez plants got that classic indica look, compact and bushy. They do well indoors and outdoors.

Indoors, their small stature is a good match for Sea of Green (SOG) setups, and you can easily train their branches for a better yield. They got some resistance to mold and mildew which is a bonus in humid spots. They pretty beginner-friendly and most folks find them easy to grow. Indoors, they usually flower in about 8 to 9 weeks. If you train 'em right, you could be looking at 13 ounces per plant, just make sure they got room to spread out.

Outdoor Zkittlez plants can get a bit bigger and yield more. They can stretch up to six feet tall, with yields up to 17 ounces per plant. You'll be ready to harvest around early October. So if you're looking for a chill, flavorful smoke that's easy to grow and gives a great yield, Zkittlez is the move, no doubt.
