# Where to Buy the Best Durban Poison Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, sit tight and light up as I break it down on this heavy-hitter, Durban Poison. This here's a pure sativa, straight outta South Africa, the offspring of some dope sativa strain they've been growing out there. Our man Ed Rosenthal, a major player in the cannabis game from America, copped the original strain back in the 70s, and it's been a top pick for heads and medical patients on this side of the pond ever since.

Durban Poison ain't no joke, my dude. It's packing serious heat with THC levels that can peak at 24%, putting it up there with the world's most potent strains. It hits you with a powerful, upbeat cerebral high that's perfect for flexing your creativity or getting your hustle on during the day. But, word to the wise, it might get you feeling a bit paranoid, and it'll definitely have your mouth feeling like cotton.

If you're dealing with some rough times or you're feeling anxious, Durban Poison can help you out. It's also good for chronic pain and can help if you're feeling nauseous. Plus, this strain is a concentrate maker's dream 'cause the buds are dripping in massive trichomes. The dominant aroma and flavor of Durban Poison is a sweet and earthy mix with a hint of pine. The nugs are solid and round, covered in a thick layer of trichomes.

This strain is perfect for when you're on your grind, taking care of business, or just out and about during the day. Growing it's pretty straight, especially indoors. If you're growing it outdoors, it can get real tall, so you gotta be ready for that. But indoors, it's a lot easier to handle. These plants are tough and they pretty much grow themselves.

When you let this 100% sativa do its thing, it can reach up to 90 inches, that's like 7.5 feet, man! Indoor plants will be a lot shorter, which is probably a good thing unless you've got a spot that can handle 8-footers. These seeds give you leafy plants with lush green buds that are loaded with resin and trichomes.

You gotta trim and prune these tall girls regularly to keep the branches from drooping and snapping off. That means getting rid of all the dead and yellow leaves. Pruning and trimming keep your weed trees looking fresh and strong.

Durban Poison seeds really shine when they're grown outdoors in the sun. If you're growing it indoors, it's best to go with a hydroponics setup instead of soil or other solid mediums. It's generally easy to grow, but if you're new to hydroponics, it might be a bit tricky at first.

Durban Poison really thrives in an outdoor, sunny environment. When you're growing the feminized seeds, they usually flower pretty quick. Indoor growers can expect flowering to happen in about 7-9 weeks. If you're growing outdoors, you'll be ready to harvest from the end of September to mid-October.

Indoor growers should get about 13 ounces of prime cannabis per plant. If you're growing outdoors, you can expect to yield about 16 ounces per plant, depending on your growing conditions. When you're harvesting Durban Poison, you're gonna get sticky, fat buds. With a high THC level, your buds are gonna be sparkling, crystallized, and super potent.
