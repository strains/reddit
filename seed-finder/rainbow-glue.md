# Where to Buy the Best Rainbow Glue Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, so let's chop it up 'bout this fire strain called Rainbow Glue. We talkin' a sweet n' sticky mix-up of Gorilla Glue #4 and Zkittlez, ya feel me? This stuff's got a heavy 22% THC level that'll have you bouncin' off the walls feelin' fly as hell, packed tight with them potent cannabinoids.

Now, this ain't your regular hybrid, it's some next level indica-dominant blend, with a gang of terpenes mixin' up citrusy and floral scents that'll make your nose do a double take. Plants got a vibe to 'em, mad easy to grow both inside and outside, and they be givin' you a hefty yield - we talkin' up to 35 oz per plant, you dig?

Both Gorilla Glue and Zkittlez are a breeze to grow, and this offspring ain't no different. You gonna get a medium-sized bush, compact and sturdy, topping out at a modest 5 foot, no matter where you grow it. And let me tell ya, these ain't just any seeds - they feminized. That means they all female plants, the kind that actually be producin' the good stuff. They start showin' their colors when the light gets low, like when fall hits, or when you play with the light indoors.

Rainbow Glue got a thing for the heat, y'know? Mediterranean, tropical vibes â€“ that's what it's about. Keep the moisture around the middle - 50% is just right. If you growin' outside, watch out for the frost, and keep that water in check. These plants play the long game, so you gonna be waitin' a bit longer for that harvest.

Now, don't get it twisted, Rainbow Glue ain't no diva. She's a strong lady that can be ready for harvest in just 10 weeks. Indoor yield can hit anywhere between 21 to 24 oz per plant (600-700 grams), that's dependin' on your lights, environment, and your skills. If you got it just right outdoors, you could be lookin' at a massive 88 oz (2500 grams), but only the realest green thumbs gonna hit those numbers.
