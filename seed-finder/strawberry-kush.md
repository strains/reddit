# Where to Buy the Best Strawberry Kush Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, let's chop it up 'bout this Strawberry Kush. No playin', this chronic is straight fire. Got that sweet, strong vibe to it, no doubt about it. No surprises here, it's got that Strawberry and OG Kush blood in its veins.

This bud be rockin' a musky, strawberry flavor, artificial but still bangin'. THC? Yeah, we talking up to 23 percent, fam, it ain't no lightweight. It's a combo of that harsh OG Kush and that candy-like Strawberry Cough. It hits hard, but it ain't gonna knock you out cold, ya feel me?

Now depending on where you cop it, the lineage might be a little different. Some spots might have a more sativa-leaning or hybrid version, and that's gonna hit you with some uplifting, energetic vibes. You ain't growing this one from seeds, though, it's all about the clones, and it's ready to harvest in about eight to nine weeks.

When you light this baby up, you'll be hit with a wave of citrus, pine, and of course, strawberry. That fruity mix gives you a clean taste, and the buzz? It's all head high, keeps you sharp and ready to roll. It's a great daytime smoke, won't have you snoozing on the couch.

From a medicinal angle, Strawberry Kush is a solid choice for folks dealing with stress or loss of appetite. It's pretty straightforward to grow, but you gotta keep your eyes on it since it's a quick bloomer. The plants stay low, usually no more than 3 feet, but they can get bushy, so the Sea of Green method might be a good fit.

You can grow Strawberry Kush indoors or outdoors, but if you take it outside, the plants can get a good bit taller. Like most indica-dominant strains, they prefer cooler temps, so they do well inside. It's a quick turn around, with flowers ready in about 8 to 9 weeks. If you treat 'em right, you can pull in a hefty 16 to 23 oz of dry bud per plant. For the outdoor growers, aim to harvest around mid-October for similar yields.
