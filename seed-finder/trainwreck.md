# Where to Buy the Best Trainwreck Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, so check this, the infamous Trainwreck ain't got its name just by chance, nah, this bad girl hits ya like a freight train after only a couple tokes. This mental joyride ain't no joke, it's a funky fusion of two sativas - that spicy Mexican and zesty Thai - and one chill indica - that calming Afghani. No doubt, this hybrid will take ya on a wild ride.

Trainwreck, bein' mainly sativa dominant with a ratio of 80:20, you best believe it brings a mellow vibe that'll have your body feelin' all kinds of nice, while your mind's sparked up with mad creative thoughts. Folk use this green goddess to help ease pain, PTSD, and stress. The potency might be high, but it's smooth enough to puff on all day, no sweat.

Them long green leaves, matched with a pine and citrus scent that's straight-up undeniable, makes this strain one of a kind. There's this tangy lemon aftertaste that might have ya coughin' a lil', but it's all part of the ride. This bad girl's covered in trichomes, givin' it a light green hue with a sneaky hint of gray.

Trainwreck's robust roots and sturdy stalks make it a top pick for home-growers and commercial cultivators alike. Some of these plants grow sky-high, almost 7 feet tall, yo. You ain't gotta fuss over it too much, just keep it trimmed to stop it spreadin' out too wide. Those flower buds will be drippin' with resin, that's how you know it's the real deal.

This strain's a master of adaptin', it can thrive outdoors or indoors. But a word to the wise, if you're a green-thumb in training, it's better to grow this baby indoors, as it prefers the sunny vibes and ain't too fond of wild temp swings. Indoors, you can keep things in check. It takes about 8 to 10 weeks for these plants to flower when grown indoors. You're lookin' at a haul of about 18 ounces per square meter, making it a favorite for those lookin' to score big.

If you're takin' the outdoor route, you might have to wait a little longer for flowering. Harvest usually rolls around from early October to mid-November. But trust, the payoff's worth the wait - you can get as much as 25 ounces per plant. Now, that's what's up.
