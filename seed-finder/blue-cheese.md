# Where to Buy the Best Blue Cheese Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, let's chop it up 'bout this one, Blue Cheese. It's an indica-dominant hybrid, runnin' like 20% sativa to 80% indica. This bad girl ain't no lightweight, with THC levels hitting that 20% mark. Just like its name be tellin' ya, it's got a mad blue cheese flavor profile, setting it apart from them other Cheese fam. On the nose, you catchin' whiffs of that pungent blue cheese blended with sweet blueberry notes.

The roots of this strain trace back to the UK, where the original Cheese strain got together with a Blueberry male. They got it on and popped out this Blue focused strain. This ain't your typical high, though. We talkin' 'bout a smooth blend of joy and euphoria with a deep-body relaxation. You can't deny the indica side when that body high hits, but the sativa keeps things lively and upbeat.

Blue Cheese is a solid pick when you need to cool off anxiety, depression, or pain. But it ain't just limited to that. Homies dealin' with migraines, PTSD, ADHD, or bipolar disorder also find some relief in this strain. For all them insomniacs out there, this one's a surefire bedtime buddy. Just watch out for them cottonmouth and dry eyes.

This Cheese lineage, along with its progeny, stay reppin' the British scene, boasting unique flavors and aromas. Coupled with its stress-busting high, it's just the thing for them late-night vibin'. Blue Cheese don't play, showin' off its strength and vigor, keepin' at bay most infections and molds. Growin' ganja ain't no joke, with molds and infections lurkin' around, but Blue Cheese got your back, making it a solid choice for them greenhorn growers.

Whether you settin' it up indoors or lettin' it breathe outdoors, Blue Cheese can handle it. Indoors gives you more control, but this strain ain't high maintenance, so outdoors can work too. As an indica-dominant, Blue Cheese can even flex in cooler climates. For optimal growth, keep it chill in temperatures ranging from 65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

Give it 'bout 8 to 9 weeks, and this strain will be ready to show off its flowers indoors, yielding 'bout 5 ounces per plant. But if you're growing it outdoors, you're lookin' at a whopping 9 ounces per plant. It starts flowering early fall, and by the time September ends, it's harvest time. Now, that's what's up with Blue Cheese, y'all.
