# Where to Buy the Best Tangie Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, peep game on this here Tangie, right? It's like Tangerine Dream got a facelift, but with a whole new genetic mix. Tangie be a blend of that Cali Orange and some Skunk lineage, while Tangerine Dream be a mashup of A5 and that iconic G-13. Even though they ain't got much in common DNA-wise, these two orange-y strains rock that same juicy, tangerine flavor profile that's all about that citrus vibe.

Now, Tangie's heavy on the sativa side, like 70:30 or thereabouts. It ain't crystal clear, but what it means for you is a high that lifts you up, sparks creativity, and floods you with joy – like the sun's shining just for you. It's a go-to for easing all kinds of ailments, from nausea and anxiety to a loss of appetite and the blues. The only downsides reported are some red eyes and a case of cottonmouth, so it might be a solid pick for those who can't handle harsh side effects.

With THC levels clocking in at a hefty 22% plus, Tangie ain't for the rookies. It packs a punch and might be too much for the newbies. But for the seasoned tokers, it's an experience. Tangie seeds birth plants that ain't fazed by molds and diseases. However, these babies grow up tight and dense, making Tangie more prone to mold than those reefer varieties that sprawl out. So, growers gotta keep an eye on temperature, humidity, and moisture levels to keep their crop mold-free.

Tangie thrives in the heat, like a citrus tree in the tropics. High heat and humidity ain't no sweat for this strain, but it's best kept between 68 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. This bad girl ain't a fan of the cold, so you gotta keep it warm.

Tangie ain't just high-quality, it's a rugged plant that rewards with quick flowering times. You can raise this bud indoors or out, and it'll give you a fat yield of up to 15 ounces in just 8 to 9 weeks. Yeah, Tangie plants can reach for the sky, but don't let that deter you from growing this strain indoors. It needs space to stretch, but it's doable. If you opt for outdoors, Tangie will flourish.

When flowering time comes around, you'll see Tangie’s distinct swag. It'll be rocking sticky flowers, vivid green leaves, and orange hairs, looking fly as hell. So that's the 411 on Tangie, a strain that's got it all – the flavor, the high, and the resilience.
