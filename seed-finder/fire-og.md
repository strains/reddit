# Where to Buy the Best Fire OG Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, check it, homie. We talkin' 'bout Fire OG, that heavy hitter that's 70% indica and 30% sativa. This bomb ass bud is a cross between that ever-loved OG Kush and the San Fernando Valley OG Kush, ya feel me? Now, let me tell ya, this ain't your regular tree; Fire OG is hailed as the realest, the most potent in the OG Kush fam, boastin' a THC level that'll knock your socks off, somethin' like 20-25% on the average.

When you spark this up, you gon' feel this creative surge, this uplifting vibe that's gonna make you feel like you could paint the Sistine Chapel or something. You gon' be hit with a wave of energy that'll have you feeling like you on top of the world, straight euphoric, homie. But don't get it twisted, this ain't a forever thing. After a while, that high gon' fade into a deep couch lock, have you raiding the fridge, then leaving you chillin' like you've been sedated.

And when the high starts to die down, it's gonna guide you into this deep, peaceful sleep. It's like a lullaby for grown folks. Because of these effects, they say Fire OG is the go-to for those dealing with chronic pain from injuries or sickness, stress, depression, or even sleep disorders like insomnia and night terrors.

When it comes to flavor, Fire OG ain't playin'. You got this earthy taste, with a lil' bit of that woody kush, and when you light it up, it's like a sweet, burning pine aroma. The nugs? They're these leafy, neon green beauties with a bunch of long, thin, fiery orange hairs, deep purple undertones, and a frosty white layer of trichomes.

But look, growin' this ain't for the faint of heart. Fire OG ain't easy to cultivate, especially for those green thumb newbies. It takes patience, my dude. Your grow spot gotta be on point to get the most out of these plants. You're better off growin' this indoors in a controlled environment. Pruning and topping off the OG will help you achieve that max yield.

Be careful though, 'cause this strain can mold quick if it gets too wet or too hot, so make sure your grow spot is ventilated right. You want soil rich in phosphorous 'cause this strain is high maintenance when it comes to nutrients. You're lookin' at about 10 to 11 weeks for a good harvest. If you're doing it right indoors, you can expect to pull about 14 ounces per plant. If you dare to grow Fire OG outdoors, you should be ready to harvest around late October and you could get around 17 ounces per plant. Trust me, it's worth the wait.
