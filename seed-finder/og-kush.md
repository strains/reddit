# Where to Buy the Best OG Kush Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, check it, we talkin' bout OG Kush, or "OGK" if you bout that short form life. This bad girl is a lil more on the sativa side, with a 55/45 split, but ain't nobody really know its parents - it's all hush hush, ya feel? Some cats reckon it's a blend of that Chemdawg and Hindu Kush, but ain't nothin' solid.

This strain right here? It's like the Jordan of medicinal bud, universally loved by both indica and sativa heads. You take a hit, and almost instantly you're blasted off into this headspace of joy and chill vibes, like everything's a little brighter.

You'll find yourself choppin' it up with anyone who's around, even if you just met 'em, and don't be surprised if you catch yourself in a giggle fit. Next thing you know, you got the munchies like a mofo, reaching for whatever snack you can get your mitts on.

With a THC range of 20-26%, OGK is a solid choice for those dealing with stress, anxiety, mood swings, depression, loss of appetite, nausea or them killer headaches. The flavor profile is straight up classic - a sour citrus tang mixed with that earthy pine taste. The aroma ain't much different, with a spicy kush scent accented by sour citrus, woody pine, and some dankness that'll hit your nostrils just right.

These nugs? Fat as hell, grape-shaped, and decked out in forest green with long, thin orange hairs, golden undertones and a shiny coat of golden-white crystal trichomes. If you're in a hot or tropical climate, OGK is for you. If not, she's still a great indoor plant. But be warned, she ain't too fond of less-than-ideal outdoor conditions - can lead to diseases, bugs, or powdery mildew.

Expect her to grow a bit taller, anywhere between 35 to 63 inches, depending on how much room she got to stretch her legs. She ain't the easiest to grow, but with some TLC, you can expect about 16 ounces of prime bud per plant and a flowering time of 8 to 9 weeks. If you're growing outdoors, the yield is about the same, and she'll be ready for harvest come October. So strap in, and get ready for a wild ride with OGK.
