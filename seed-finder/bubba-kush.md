# Where to Buy the Best Bubba Kush Cannabis Seeds Online

Yo, we talkin' 'bout Bubba Kush up in here, that's BK or Bubba, for the homies who know. This bad girl got that indica dominance, 80% strong, with a 20% sativa touch. Folks ain't sure 'bout its parents, but some peeps think it's a mix of Afghani and OG Kush. This strain is hella respected, both by growers and users, cause it takes you on a sky-high trip that lasts for ages.

The BK hit starts with a low-key uplift of the spirits, flooding your dome with such bliss, ain't no room for negativity or racing thoughts. This mental joyride can have you feeling a bit spaced out and might even hit you with some sleepiness. Alongside this, you got a chill body high that washes over you, leaving you calm and pain-free for hours on end.

With its THC level floating between 14-25%, Bubba Kush is a top choice for those battling mood swings, depression, muscle spasms, chronic stress, and ongoing pain. It's got a flavor like a sweet, hashy cup of floral coffee, with a hint of rich, spicy chocolate. The smell is like a combo of earthy hash, mocha coffee, and a sprinkle of spicy flowers.

Bubba Kush buds got this oversized, airy, heart-shaped look, rocking a dark olive green color with long, thin, bright orange hairs. They're coated in tiny white crystal trichomes, dripping with that sweet sticky resin. This plant does its best in dry and moderate climates, with optimal growing temps between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Indoor growing is a good move for this strain because it needs some extra love like nitrogen, calcium, and magnesium.

Using a Sea of Green technique will get you the most yield, and if you can set up a hydroponic system, this strain will love you for it. Its small size is a plus, and your yield will probably benefit from the extra attention hydroponics provides. Bubba Kush is loved by growers cause it only gets up to 'bout 56 inches tall. Indoors, it needs 8-9 weeks to flower, yielding up to 14 ounces per 3 square feet.

If you're growing outdoors, you can expect up to 17 ounces per plant. Remember, this strain likes it dry, so keep the moisture low. By the end of October, your plants should be ready for harvest, loaded with those sweet, resin-dripping buds. Bubba Kush ain't easy to grow, but with the right care, it rewards you big time.
