# Where to Buy the Best Harlequin Cannabis Seeds Online

Yo, check it out. Harlequin, that's a crazy hybrid mix of Colombian Gold, Thai, and Swiss Landrace. It's got this wild ratio of indica to sativa, 25:75, so you know it's leaning hard on the sativa side. What sets this baby apart is its CBD to THC ratio, straight up about 1:1. That means you're looking at a THC level of 7-15% and a CBD level of 4-10%.

Flavor-wise, this thing is off the chain. You're gonna get a smack of mango mixed with some earthy musk, and it's that flavor fusion that's got everyone talking. Harlequin ain't just about taste, though. This strain is a chill master, dropping you into a state of relaxation that still keeps you sharp and focused. That's the headline feature right there.

Physically, this thing is a beast. Dense, thick nugs all over and glittering with trichomes like a diamond necklace. Now, ain't no strain perfect, and Harlequin can give you dry mouth, dry eyes, and maybe a little nausea or a headache if you overdo it.

When it comes to growing, this medical marijuana strain is pretty generous. It's most commonly grown indoors, taking about two to two and a half months to flower. It's a heavyweight when it comes to pain relief, working wonders on body aches and headaches. Plus, the low THC level keeps you aware and in control.

The Harlequin plant is hardy, fighting off diseases, molds, and pests like a champ. It grows good in hydro or soil, but a controlled environment is a must to keep that CBD level right. It can handle high humidity and likes it warm, between 72 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Too hot, though, and it'll dry up and die on you.

You can grow Harlequin indoors or out, just make sure that soil is nutrient-rich. If you're going the hydro route, pump that plant with oxygen in the late flowering stage to boost bud production. Growing ain't too tough, it's a moderate level gig. Indoors, you're looking at about 8 to 9 weeks to flower and about 14 ounces per plant. Outdoors, you'll get around 17 ounces per plant. Harvest in early fall, and you're golden.
