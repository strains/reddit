# Where to Buy the Best Do-Si-Dos Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, so let's chop it up about Do-Si-Dos. Now, this ain't your average green. This joint right here, it's a potent blend of Girl Scout Cookies and Face Off OG, making it a 70/30 indica-dominant hybrid that ain't for the faint-hearted, ya feel me?

Now, the first thing that's gonna catch you is that sweet, minty cookie flavor. It's like biting into a fresh pack of Thin Mints, my dude. Can't blame you if you can't get enough of it. Just be careful, though. This kush packs a whopping 28-30% THC level. Overdo it, and you'll find yourself on a one-way trip to la-la land.

The aroma's just as intoxicating. It's got that sweet minty smell, but it ain't just that. There's a hint of fresh lime and pine in there, too. Gives it that fresh, outdoorsy vibe. Once you move past that flavor, the effects are just as dope. The high hits you like a freight train, starting with a cerebral rush of euphoria that eventually fades into a happy, introspective stone.

As your mind starts to wander, you'll feel this warming buzz creeping down your spine, spreading to your limbs, leaving you all sedated and couch-locked. This beast of a strain is perfect for those experienced stoners looking for relief from insomnia, chronic pain, nausea, and even depression.

The buds on this bad girl are like little green nuggets of joy. Olive green, to be exact, with bright amber hairs, purple leaves, and a sweet, syrupy resin that covers every frosty white trichome. If you're looking to grow your own, Do-Si-Dos ain't too challenging. It's a forgiving strain that rewards you with a hefty yield, whether you're growing indoors or out.

Do-Si-Dos plants like it sunny and humid, and they ain't too bothered by mold, mildew, or pests. Just make sure to prune those dense leaves to let some light and air through. Indoor growers, be ready for that powerful stench. An exhaust fan or carbon air filters are a must.

Aesthetically, Do-Si-Dos is a sight to behold. Vibrant hues of lavender, lime, and amber give it an eye-catching, almost psychedelic look. The pistils grow abundantly, adding their rich amber color to the mix. And then there's that thick layer of crystalline trichomes, making it look like the plant's been dusted with sugar.

To grow Do-Si-Dos, you'll need a sunny, semi-humid climate. You can pull this off indoors or outdoors. Keep your daytime temperature between 70℉ and 80℉ (or 21℃-26℃) and check your humidity levels. If you want to bring out those purple tones in the leaves, expose your plants to cooler nighttime temps just before flowering starts. But don't get it too cold or keep them out for too long.

Growing Do-Si-Dos ain't too hard, but you gotta know your stuff. The payoff's worth it, though: quick flowering time and a high yield. Just make sure your setup's up to snuff. Indoors, these plants can reach heights of 2.6ft to 3.3ft (80-100cm), but outdoors, they can grow over 8ft (2.5 meters). Indoors, expect a flowering time of 8 to 9 weeks, with yields of about 14 to 18 oz per plant under optimal conditions. An outdoor plant will be ready for harvest in late September or early October, pulling in a hefty yield of up to 18 oz/plant.
