# Where to Buy the Best Skywalker OG Cannabis Seeds Online

Yo, check it, Skywalker OG, also called "Skywalker OG Kush" by the herb community, is a straight fire indica-dominant hybrid. It's a solid mix of that Skywalker and OG Kush, with the indica coming in strong at 85% and sativa holding down the rest at 15%. This bud got a heavy THC level, riding between 20-26% on the average, bringing both indica and sativa vibes to the table.

Skywalker OG got that spicy, herbal jet fuel aroma that hits your nostrils hard. The flavor is like a diesel kick to the mouth with a herby aftertaste that lingers. This bud's got medium-sized, dense, round olive green nugs, with burnt orange twisty hairs and rich orange undertones, looking like little nuggets of gold.

These nugs are coated with a fine layer of milky white trichomes and sweet, sticky resin that'll have your fingers feeling like you've been handling honey. This high is a heavy stone that'll have you locked down on your couch, totally chilled out and lazy, with a serious case of the munchies that'll have you raiding the fridge.

Along with that body high comes a euphoric head high that'll have you feeling like your head's in the clouds, fading into a deep, peaceful sleep when you come down. With these strong effects, Skywalker OG is perfect for treating chronic stress, pain from injury or illness, and mild to moderate cases of depression.

If you're looking for an outdoor plant that loves the sun, got solid yields, and is a step up from beginner grows, Skywalker OG got you covered. This plant loves the sun and needs a lot of space, meaning indoor growing is doable, but not the best move. Outdoors, this plant thrives like a beast.

But keep in mind the humidity. If you're in a high humidity area, this ain't gonna be the best plant for you. The higher the humidity, the harder it's gonna be for the plant to soak up all the sunlight it craves. You're gonna need a dry, bright spot to grow this. Yields depend on the conditions. Light, nutrients, and plant care all play a part. When everything's right, Skywalker OG could yield a crazy 17 ounces of usable bud per plant, as long as it's got plenty of sunlight and space.

If you're growing indoors, keep the temp steady between 68 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It flowers in about 9 to 10 weeks, and with proper care, you might pull almost a pound per plant area when it's harvest time.
