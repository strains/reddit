# Where to Buy the Best Candy Kush Cannabis Seeds Online

Yo, we talkin' 'bout Candy Kush here, and it'll take you to the candy shop and have you spendin' all you got. This sweet ride is a lil' more on the indica side of things, rockin' 60% indica and 40% sativa, birthed from the legends themselves, OG Kush and Blue Dream.

This honey is renowned for its wicked flavor and full-bodied high that'll take you to another dimension. Just like its name drops, Candy Kush serves up a sweet candy-like taste with a splash of sour citrus on the exhale, making your taste buds do the Harlem Shake.

Aroma-wise, this bad girl ain't playin'. You get a sour citrusy vibe mixed with some earthy kush undertones, finished off with a dash of fresh tree fruits, like walkin' through a grove on a sunny day.

When it comes to the high, Candy Kush ain't no joke. You'll be feelin' chilled from head to toe, with zero room for any negative vibes or mind races. This ride comes complete with a tingly body high that'll leave you feelin' relaxed and sometimes, just sometimes, a lil' bit frisky.

With THC levels hitting between 20-30% and CBD floating around 0-3%, this dynamite strain is perfect for those warriors battling chronic pain, muscle spasms, stress, anxiety, depression, and mood swings. It's like a herbal superhero, swooping in to save the day.

Candy Kush buds are like little green hearts, dark olive in color with a splash of deep purple underneath. They're wrapped in dark amber hairs and sprinkled with frosty white crystal trichomes that got a hint of royal purple.

Candy Kush plants ain't too tall, standing around 60 inches, and they're cool to grow 'cause they pack a THC punch of 18%, decent CBD levels, and don't need you to baby them all the time. They perform well indoors with scrogging techniques or low-stress training. Outdoors, they prefer it a bit cooler, but don't sweat the mold 'cause these babies got resistance.

For my peeps living in cooler climates, Candy Kush might just be your dream strain. These plants got a ton of resin, even though they got a short flowering period of 7-9 weeks. Indoor yields average around 14 ounces per three plants, and outdoor grows kick up about 17 ounces per plant. So you get yourself some Candy Kush, and you'll be floating on cloud nine in no time.
