# Where to Buy the Best Cookies and Cream Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, check it, we talkin' 'bout Cookies and Cream here, a straight-up 60/40 split hybrid bred from Starfighter mixed with some unidentified Girl Scout Cookies strain. This dank-ass bud snatched the 1st Place trophy for Best Hybrid at the 2014 Denver Cannabis Cup, cause of its crazy good taste and potent-ass hybrid power.

When you hit this, it tastes just like it sounds, homie – sweet vanilla vibes with a nutty earth undertone and a creamy butter finish. The aroma? Just as bomb, with sweet, nutty earthiness and a hint of vanilla when you blaze it up.

This bud got popcorn-shaped, dark green nugs that be having some deep purple undertones, flaming orange hairs, and a frosty blanket of crystal trichomes that shine clear as day.

Now, the high from Cookies and Cream ain't no joke. It hits you with a joyful head lift that's both euphoric and creative, giving you a little buzz of energy. That's followed by a mellow, sleep-inducing effect that leaves you chilled out and blissfully oblivious to any pain or the world around you.

With a crazy high average THC level of 26%, this strain is perfect for dealing with things like chronic stress, anxiety, nausea, insomnia, muscle spasms, and even depression.

Growing Cookies and Cream ain't for the faint-hearted, but for the experienced grower, it can yield average-sized buds with dark green flowers and yellow pistils. If you know what you're doing, you can get trichome-covered flowers spread all over tall plants. Lollipop your plants to make the most out of your lights, and top 'em for the fattest yields.

These weed plants thrive best indoors, but they ain't picky – they'll do well in hydroponic grows too. Just make sure you give 'em enough space indoors cause they can easily stretch up to five feet. Keep an eye on temps, don't let 'em swing too much, feed regularly, and maintain a steady humidity level.

If you're growing outdoors, Cookies and Cream plants like it Mediterranean style (70-80 degrees) with some humidity. Plan for taller plants and prune them for maximum sunlight exposure.

Now, if you're doing it right, you can expect a decent yield from this strain – anywhere from 12 to 16 ounces per square meter indoors. Outdoor growers can get about 16 ounces per plant. Techniques like topping and lollipopping can boost your yields even more.

Indoor flowering usually takes about 8 to 9 weeks. If you're growing outdoors, be ready to harvest around late September to early October, given you've got optimal conditions. There you have it, the lowdown on the Cookies and Cream strain.
