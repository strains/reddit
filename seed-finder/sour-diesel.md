# Where to Buy the Best Sour Diesel Cannabis Seeds Online

Yo, peep game on this loud pack, Sour Diesel, or as the homies call it, that "Sour D" or "Sour Deez." This joint right here, it's a sativa-dominant hybrid, flexing with a 90:10 sativa to indica ratio. Ain't no one in the cannabis clique can agree on where Sour D came from, ya feel me? Some heads say it's a blend of mass super skunk and 91 Chemdog, while others insist it's a crossbreed of Mexican sativa and a Chemdog phenotype. Either way, you can bet your bottom dollar it's gonna take you to cloud nine.

Ain't no couch lock or heavy vibes with this flame, nah, it's all about that cerebral upliftment, opening doors to creativity like a key to a lock. The medical patients use it heavy to alleviate anxiety, depression, and chronic fatigue. Despite having a touch of indica, don't expect this to help with insomnia or similar sleep issues. This strain got that stimulating, lively head high that gets you up and moving.

Sour Diesel is the perfect wake and bake, with its energetic buzz, it's the morning coffee of cannabis, the perfect start to your day. The potency ain't too heavy, just enough to elevate your mind and become your daily toke. You wondering why it's called Diesel? Take a whiff, it's got one of the loudest aromas out there, like straight diesel gas with a slice of lemon. On the toke, it's smooth sailing with a slight hint of citrus on the exhale.

Look at this beauty, dense light green buds covered in orange hairs like a fox's tail. Sour Diesel thrives in sunny, warm spots. Outdoor cultivation can be a challenge though, as it's susceptible to that powdery mildew. For outdoor grows, aim for that dry, hot climate, the less humidity the better. If you're going the indoor route, you're gonna need some high-intensity lights and a dry, sterile grow space. Keep it compact, and after around 10 weeks of flowering, you'll be ready to harvest.

If you're lucky enough to have the right outdoor conditions, let these ladies grow big. They can produce massive yields, a real cash crop. Despite the mildew issue, Sour D is pretty sturdy, resistant to most diseases, molds, and pests that can mess with your grow.

For indoor grows, expect about 9 to 10 weeks of flowering before you can start trimming. Under the right conditions, you could pull in around 16 ounces per plant. If you're growing outdoors, plan on harvesting by November at the latest. Given enough sunlight and proper nutrients, Sour Diesel can turn into a real monster bush. So, there you have it, all you need to know about that Sour Diesel. Now go get your grow on!
