# Where to Buy the Best Hindu Kush Cannabis Seeds Online

A'ight, peep this: Hindu Kush, this 100% pure indica strain, is straight from the rugged peaks 'tween Pakistan and Afghanistan. This bud's got a serious rep worldwide for its chill-out indica vibes and the long-lasting blaze that’s a perfect fit for a laid-back day or those restless nights when you just gotta unwind.

Now, this Hindu Kush high ain't no joke, it's got a sneaky build-up that creeps on both your headspace and body before it grabs hold. You'll feel a wave of euphoria seep into your thoughts, pushing out any negative or racing ideas, and leave you feeling delightfully unfocused and foggy. As your mind dips into oblivion, your body's gonna follow suit, locking you to the couch and leaving you totally zonked out for a good long while. In no time, you'll start feeling that sleepiness creep up on you, leaving you dozing off and on as your mind and body drift away.

Thanks to these marathon effects and its high 22-32% average THC level, folks say Hindu Kush is just the ticket for dealing with stuff like cramps or muscle spasms, chronic pain, IBS, insomnia, and loss of appetite or nausea. This bud's got a skunky, earthy taste with a sweet floral exhale that's got a touch of fresh woods. The scent is hella pungent and fragrant with a floral hint that's mixed in with fresh herbs and spicy pine.

Hindu Kush buds are these oversized, heart-shaped bright forest green nuggets with vivid orange hairs and a layer of amber crystal trichomes. This ganja plant usually grows dense, bushy, and short, but it can stretch out a bit if it's given enough space to thrive. Hindu Kush needs a climate similar to its homeland—dry and warm. This big herb can grow outdoors or indoors, as long as the warm climate it needs is kept in check.

Due to the harsh climate of its homeland, this strain is naturally potent with thick coats of trichomes. These plants produce these crystals for some self-defense against the environment. Hindu Kush is perfect for indoor growing 'cause it can be grown in small spaces. Experts recommend using a Sea of Green (SOG) technique to get the most out of your yield. But remember to keep that airflow good to help keep humidity in check. If you can keep the air dry, this strain is a breeze to grow. It's perfect for those just getting into the game.

Hindu Kush takes about 7 to 8 weeks to flower when grown indoors. Once harvested, these plants will yield a hefty 14 ounces per plant. If you're growing outdoors, expect about 17 ounces per plant. Full-flowering happens from late-September to early-October.
