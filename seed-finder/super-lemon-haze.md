# Where to Buy the Best Super Lemon Haze Cannabis Seeds Online

A'ight, y'all, strap in and peep game at this boss-level sativa-heavy hybrid, known as Super Lemon Haze. This joint right here ain't no runner-up, it snatched the gold in the Medical Sativa division at the 2014 Seattle Cannabis Cup, so you know it ain't playin'. Born and bred in Washington by local growers Olympia Mike and A Green Cure, this bad girl's got roots.

SLH, as the homies call it, is a wild mix of Lemon Skunk and Super Silver Haze, packin' a sativa/indica ratio of 80:20. This blend hits you with that cerebral high, gettin' your mind buzzin', stokin' the fires of creativity, and pumpin' out energy like a power plant. It's all about happiness, euphoria, and even gettin' you feelin' a lil' frisky, feel me?

Got that depression, fatigue, anxiety, nausea, or chronic pain weighing you down? Super Lemon Haze is your go-to, your magic ticket, your antidote. With THC levels that can skyrocket over 25%, this strain is sittin' high on the potency totem pole. But don't get it twisted, this ain't your cure-all for every situation. Its CBD levels are low, like below 1% low, so it ain't the best choice for stuff that needs that CBD touch, like seizure disorders.

Now let's talk taste and aroma. Super Lemon Haze is all up in your face with that zesty lemon flavor and smell, sweetened up with some candy notes to keep it smooth. The bud's got a green-and-brown speckled look, blanketed by a thick layer of resinous trichomes that'd make any cannabis connoisseur grin.

Growing SLH ain't no child's play, but with a lil' love and care, you'll see it flourish. Expect to see these marijuana trees tower over six feet tall. They're good at fending off pests and molds, and if you're looking for a big yield, these plants got you covered.

For real though, if you want the best out of this strain, grow it indoors. If you ain't got that option, make sure you got that warm, Mediterranean-like climate if you're growing it outdoors. Hydroponics is the way to go for max flowering and yield potential. SLH ain't scared of a lil' extra humidity during the flowering stage, and with a flowering time of 9 to 10 weeks indoors, you're looking at a yield of up to 21 ounces of fire bud per plant, given your green thumb is on point.

If you're doing the outdoor thing, plan for an October harvest. Under the right conditions, you could be looking at an outdoor yield of a whopping 25 ounces. Super Lemon Haze ain't your average strain, it's a champ that's guaranteed to bring the heat.
