# Where to Buy the Best Amnesia Haze Cannabis Seeds Online

Yo, check it, we talkin' 'bout Amnesia Haze, a dope sativa-heavy hybrid comin' from some Jamaican and Laotian sativa roots mixed with a lil' Afghan Hawaiian indica. This bad girl's rollin' with an 80:20 sativa to indica ratio, perfect for that daytime blaze when you still gotta keep your head on straight.

This strain ain't messin' around, it's got that strong THC game, hittin' up to 22% in some tests, but the CBD be chillin' under 1%. If you're lookin' for epilepsy relief or CBD benefits, this might not be your go-to. But if you're battlin' anxiety, depression, fatigue, ADHD, migraines, mood swings or physical pain, this haze got your back.

The high? Straight fire. It's gonna get your creativity flowin', your spirits soarin', and might even have you laughin' your ass off. This stuff tastes like fresh, fruity hash with a sweet, earthy aroma laced with a hint of spicy pepper. The buds? Straight up beautiful, light green with darker brown hairs all wrapped up in a frosty layer of trichomes. But watch out, this haze might leave you with some cottonmouth and red eyes. Some folks also report feelin' a bit paranoid or dizzy.

Growin' Amnesia Haze ain't no walk in the park. This baby needs a lot of sun and heat, just like a Mediterranean vacay. If you're growin' outdoors, you gotta keep it between 72 to 80 degrees, and watch out for pests, they love this stuff. Inside might be easier, where the limbs spread out more horizontally, growing into a low, wide bush, usually chillin' under 4 feet.

You gotta keep these plants lit and breezy so the lower branches can flower. And don't forget to trim those big leaves at the top. But heads up, this ain't the quickest cash crop, it takes a good minute to fully mature, so it might not be your money-maker. You're lookin' at 9 to 12 weeks to flower, which ain't ideal for retail.

But for personal cultivation, you can raise this strain from seeds or clone it from bud clippings. One dope thing about the long flowering time? You're lookin' at about 2 ounces or 60 grams of usable bud per square foot. Indoors, it's usually ready in about 9 weeks, yieldin' roughly 21 ounces per square meter. If you're growin' outside and the conditions are on point, you could be lookin' at 25 ounces per plant, ready to harvest by late October. So if you got the time and the patience, Amnesia Haze could be your new best bud.
