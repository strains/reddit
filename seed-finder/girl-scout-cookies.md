# Where to Buy the Best Girl Scout Cookies Cannabis Seeds Online

A'ight, lemme put y'all on game 'bout this boss strain known as Girl Scout Cookies. This right here ain't no lil' girl's cookie sale, nah, it's an indica-dominant hybrid, with a good measure of sativa mixed in — we talking 'bout a 40:60 split.

See, this dynamite strain ain't playing with the THC levels. It be hitting up to 28%, making it one of the hardest hitters for medical marijuana patients out there. You get the best of both worlds with this one, part sativa, part indica, delivering a high that'll make you feel like you on cloud nine, but also have you locked down on your couch, chilling.

The taste? Oh, it's got that sweet, earthy flavor that'll have your taste buds doing a happy dance. And the smell ain't nothing different. Now, it works wonders for those dealing with anxiety, stress, and depression, and it'll even get your munchies going. But watch out for that cotton mouth, though it ain't nothing a little H2O can't fix.

This powerhouse strain is the lovechild of OG Kush and a balanced hybrid, Durban Poison X F1. It first hit the scene out in Cali and now it's got folks from the West Coast to the East Coast going crazy for it. That high from GSC ain't no quick hit, it lasts for hours, giving you more bang for your buck.

Growing GSC might test your patience a bit, but trust, it's becoming a favorite among home growers. This ain't no fragile flower, it's a hardy plant, resistant to pests and all that bad stuff. It can grow up to 66 inches, so make sure you got enough room if you're growing indoors 'cause this bad girl loves to stretch out.

Got about 70 days? That's all you need for a grow cycle with GSC. It loves a warm climate, think Mediterranean vibes. But if it's a little cooler, you're in for a treat — the buds turn a light purple and get all frosty with crystals!

Now, if you're growing outdoors, you could be looking at up to 21 ounces per plant, given the right conditions. Indoors, you could be hitting the same numbers if you got the space for it. But remember, this ain't no one-size-fits-all. Your yield is gonna depend on how you care for your plants. So, there you have it, fam. GSC is that strain that'll keep you coming back for more. Get growing, and enjoy the ride.
