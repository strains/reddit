# Where to Buy the Best CBD Kush Cannabis Seeds Online

Yo, CBD Kush ain't just any ol' strain, my man, it's a straight 50/50, sativa to indica ratio, born from a fly mix of the tasty Kandy Kush and some mystery high-CBD strain. This bud's got mad reputation for its high CBD to THC ratio, reaching about 16% CBD and 6-9% THC, making it a fave for both those in pain and breeders on the grind.

Now, this ain't your typical 'get high and fly' kind of bud. Nah, the high CBD levels keep it all chill, working magic on pain and inflammation like no other. The first hit brings on this low-key euphoria that straight up erases any mental stress or racing thoughts you might have. Alongside that, you get this soft body buzz, enough to take the edge off any muscle pain, but not enough to glue you to the couch. No sedation, no loss of movement, just pure relaxation.

For folks battling chronic pain, inflammation, muscle spasms, tremors, or just living with constant anxiety or stress, CBD Kush is your ride or die. The flavor profile ain't too intense either, just a mellow blend of sweet, earthy, floral vibes that make every hit a smooth journey. The aroma follows suit, offering a subtly sweet, earthy scent that's as gentle as a whisper.

Look at these buds, though. Dense, heavy, foxtail-shaped nugs glowing bright neon green with rich amber hairs and a sticky sweet resin that'll have your fingers sticking together. These seeds are as tough as they come, growing strong under most conditions. The feminized CBD Kush seeds grow to a decent 4 feet indoors, but give them some sunshine and space outdoors, and they'll stretch up to a whopping 10 feet.

This plant ain't no pushover either. It's got the power to fend off common pests, molds, and diseases that might try to mess with your grow. Indoor growers, y'all can expect your plants to be blooming in about 8 to 9 weeks. Depending on the size of your space, you could be pulling in a solid 16 ounces of usable bud per plant. Outdoor growers, you're looking at up to 21 ounces of usable green per plant. Now that's what I call a good yield, ya dig?
