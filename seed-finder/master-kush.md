# Where to Buy the Best Master Kush Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, so check this out, playa. We talkin' 'bout Master Kush, that gangsta indica leanin' hybrid, rollin' 10% sativa to a hefty 90% indica. This ain't no lightweight, it's packin' a THC level peaking at a solid 20%, making it one of the heaviest hitters on the medical scene.

This bad girl's a cross between that OG Hindu Kush and some pure skunk strain, but the exact genetic blueprint's kinda hush-hush, ya feel me? These two parent strains are some of the hardest in the game, ain't no doubt. An' the offspring? Master Kush, one of the most famous strains worldwide, even got a couple of Cannabis Cup awards under its belt. Even the Doggfather, Snoop D-O-double-G, keeps this one close.

Born and raised in the Netherlands, this strain still holds it down over there, but it's been makin' waves on the US West Coast too. It's got that earthy sweetness on the taste, with a subtle hint of citrus on the nose that's kinda low-key, but it's there.

When you light it up, it's all about that chill, that peace, that euphoria, man. Makes you wanna just kick back and snooze, all thanks to its solid genetic lineage. It's a top-notch remedy for those sleepless nights, and it's got your back if you're dealing with anxiety, mental health issues, or migraines. It's mostly good vibes, but watch out for that cottonmouth, it's a common side effect with this one.

Growin' Master Kush ain't no biggie for some green thumbs, but it might be a bit of a challenge for others. This strain loves that hot tropical climate, soaking up all them sun rays through its dense nuggets. It's a compact plant, sturdy and thick, perfect for small grow spaces. But don't let its size fool you, it's resistant to pests, molds, and parasites, making it an easy strain to manage.

Got a hydroponic setup? Perfect. Despite its small size, Master Kush is a hungry little beast, and hydroponic growing lets you give this petite ganja plant all the TLC it needs. Indoors, it takes about 7 to 9 weeks to flower, yielding around 14 ounces per plant. If you're cultivatin' outdoors, you can rake in a solid 18 ounces per plant, with harvest time popping off in September or October. That's the lowdown on Master Kush, fam. Keep it ðŸ’¯!
