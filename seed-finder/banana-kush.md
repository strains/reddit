# Where to Buy the Best Banana Kush Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, so peep this. We talkin' 'bout Banana Kush, right? This here's a dope cross of two heavyweight champs: that West Coast boss OG Kush, and that mind-blowing Skunk Haze. You feel me? This baby's smooth as silk and leans heavy on the indica side, runnin' a 60:40 indica to sativa ratio.

Banana Kush be packin' a punch too, with THC levels hitting anywhere from 18% to 25%. CBD? Nah, barely a drop, like 0.1%. Now, if you talkin' 'bout taste, ain't no one in Cali does it better. This strain's got that golden ticket, ya dig?

Man, the high off this is like a standing ovation. It's heavy on the zzz's, so it's perfect for those late-night sessions. Trust, you ain't gonna be up late with this. Best to hit it an hour before you plan to crash.

Got sleep problems? Insomnia? This strain's got the magic touch. It's like a lullaby in a blunt. Pain, stress, whatever's got you down, Banana Kush got your back. It's even been known to help the folks struggling with glaucoma, muscle tension, and eating disorders.

The flavor? Imagine a fruit salad, but make it smokeable. It's got this sweet banana aroma that's outta this world.

As for growing this beauty, indoors is where it's at. Hydroponics if you can swing it. She ain't too tall, so if you're working with limited space, make sure to keep her trimmed and trained. Ain't no walk in the park to grow, but if you're a seasoned green thumb, you won't break a sweat. Just keep the nutrients stacked, you'll need 'em.

Banana Kush likes to feel the heat, so aim for temps between 68 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Got a greenhouse or live somewhere warm? You could take this party outside. Just make sure your grow space got good airflow. Keep humidity low, about 40%, when she's flowering.

Speaking of flowering, indoors, you're looking at 7 to 9 weeks for Banana Kush to do her thing. Yields are decent, experienced growers can pull down about 17 ounces per plant. If you're growing outdoors, you might be looking at 21 ounces per plant. Harvest time? Early October. Now, that's what's up!
