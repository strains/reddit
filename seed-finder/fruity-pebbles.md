Aight, check it out, Fruity Pebbles, a 50/50 hybrid strain, a real OG, born from Grandaddy Purps, Green Ribbon, and Tahoe Alien, ain't nothin' to sleep on. This joint right here, straight fire, got that unique mix of indica and sativa, the perfect one-two punch for your late-night chill session.

Picture this, you know the Fruity Pebbles cereal, right? That sweet, fruity explosion, sugar-coated grapes, ripe berries, and that tart tropical citrus, that's what we talkin' 'bout when you spark this up. The aroma, on point, got that fruity vibe with a dash of nuttiness, and you can't miss that tropical citrus and fruit blend, it's like a tropical island vacation in every puff.

Now, the high from this baby, straight delicious, it's gonna get you feelin' all sorts of ways before it lays you down for a good night's rest. Got you chillin' in your mind and body, with this nice, floaty buzz that's gonna spark your creativity while you kicked back. But don't get too comfortable, cause that buzz turns into a heavy helmet, leaving you feelin' all sorts of faded and disconnected from reality.

With its potent THC level ranging from 23-29%, Fruity Pebbles is the go-to for dealing with things like chronic stress or anxiety, insomnia, and even chronic pain and depression. The bud itself, straight-up eye candy, oversized grape-shaped nugs, with that emerald green color, minty undertones, thin orange hairs, and tiny, shiny golden-white crystal trichomes.

Just like the cereal, the Fruity Pebbles plant got that colorful vibe, bright orange hairs all over the nugs. Its thicc stalks and dense leaves show off its indica roots, but once it starts flowering, you can see the sativa in it stretching up to five feet. As soon as the flowering stage hits, the aroma, heavy, starts taking over.

Some might say growing this strain is a challenge because of its size. But, this bad girl doubles in size while growing, and with some plant training techniques like lollipopping, you can improve the yield and the quality.

Fruity Pebbles ain't picky, it grows well in most climates as long as you keep the temperatures between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit with plenty of light. Watch out for the dense buds, though, you're gonna need good ventilation and controlled humidity, but don't stress, this strain got a strong defense against mold.

After a short vegetative period, Fruity Pebbles takes about eight weeks to flower. These seeds are quick to finish, outdoor growers can start harvesting as early as late September, depending on where they at. Yields can be pretty generous, but that depends on the conditions or the grower's skills. On average, you're looking at about 15 ounces, especially if you got plenty of space or if you're growing outdoors.
