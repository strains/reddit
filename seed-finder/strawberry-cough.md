# Where to Buy the Best Strawberry Cough Cannabis Seeds Online

Aight, so peep this. Strawberry Cough, it's that sativa-heavy hybrid, ya dig? We talkin' 80% sativa, 20% indica, birthed from the dope combo of Haze and Strawberry Fields. It's got clout worldwide, known for its bomb flavor that'll have your head spinnin' in the best way. If you're a sativa stan, this strain gotta make your bucket list, no cap.

On the real, Strawberry Cough ain't playin' with its name. It hits your tastebuds with a sweet strawberry twist, but on the low, it's got that peppery punch on the exhale. Smells just as fire, with that fresh strawberry vibe mixed with a hit of spicy herbs, some earthy pepper, and just a sprinkle of sweetness.

This high ain't for the weak, nah. It'll have you coughing, elevating your mind and expanding your consciousness, all while leaving you gasping with each breath. You'll catch a wave of energy and creativity that'll have you ready to hustle on any creative gig. Along with this, you'll also feel a calming body high that'll ease any muscle tension without leaving you couch-locked. Considering its THC levels averaging between 22-26%, Strawberry Cough is a solid pick for battling chronic stress, anxiety, mood swings, depression, or PTSD.

The nuggets on this one? Dense, conical, and neon green, studded with thick red-orange hairs and covered with a frosty blanket of milky white trichomes. Strawberry Cough ain't no diva when it comes to growing. It naturally sprouts into a bushy form, so ain't no need for training. Just trim off the unnecessary leaves and make sure it gets a good breeze, and it'll flourish into its best, most lush self.

Indoors, expect this baby to flower within 9 to 10 weeks before you can harvest. If you're growing outdoors, plan for a harvest around October. With proper care, you could yield around 14 ounces from one plant. Take it outside and you might even score up to 17 ounces. But remember, for maximum yield, this plant needs all the right conditions: plenty of light, the right temperature and humidity, and the right nutrients. That's the lowdown on Strawberry Cough, fam.
