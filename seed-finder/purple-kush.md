# Where to Buy the Best Purple Kush Cannabis Seeds Online

Alright, let's spit some straight facts 'bout this bomb-ass herb, Purple Kush. This heavy hitter's straight up Indica, no chaser, a tight mix of that fire Hindu Kush and Purple Afghani. High Times magazine ain't playing when they tagged it as one of the Top 10 Most Powerful Strains on the globe, boasting a solid THC level that be hittin' 'round 22%.

When you get to puffin' on that Purple Kush, it hits you with an uplifting head high that'll have you feelin' on cloud nine, leaving all that pain in the dust. You'll start feeling a bit introspective, like you're in your own world. Then that warm, numbing body high comes creeping in, starting from the top and working its way down, leaving you chillin' like a villain and totally laid-back.

When the high starts to wear off, it'll slide you into a deep, dreamless sleep that ain't broken by no aches or pains. Purple Kush's got a rep for being the perfect remedy for folks dealing with issues like insomnia, chronic pain, nerve damage, and muscle spasms.

This bud's got a scent that'll make you think you're strolling through a vineyard, all earthy sweet grapes, and a taste that's got that earthy red wine vibe. The nugs are small and bright, like neon green furballs with splashes of rich purple, fire orange hairs, and dark purple undertones. They're all frosty with fine white trichomes and sticky with sweet resin.

As for growing this bad girl, it can hold its own indoors or outdoors, long as you keep the conditions steady. Most seasoned growers ain't got no issue with it, but its compact, bushy nature might throw off rookies. Purple Kush loves cool climates if you're growing it outside, and it's tough enough to fend off most pests and parasites, as long as it's got the right temp and airflow.

Regardless of where you plant it, you gotta keep it pruned to maintain healthy airflow. The Screen for Green (SCROG) technique works best for this bushy strain. Purple Kush ain't picky, it'll thrive in a hydroponic setup too, just make sure it's getting all the nutrients it needs. Keep it on the cool side though, with temps between 65 and 75 Fahrenheit being just right.

Don't worry, this plant won't keep you waiting too long for it to flower. If grown indoors, it'll be ready in about 7 to 8 weeks. Under prime conditions, you could be looking at about 9 ounces of usable bud per plant. If you're growing it outside, you'll be ready to harvest by late September. If you know what you're doing, you could pull in about 15 ounces per plant.
