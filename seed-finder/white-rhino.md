# Where to Buy the Best White Rhino Cannabis Seeds Online

Yo, check this out, White Rhino, it ain't no basic grass. This is some heavy-duty Indica-dominant hybrid vibe (80% Indica and 20% Sativa) birthed from the classic White Widow and North American Indica strains. This A-list offspring got a stunner look and a mellow high that's just the ticket for lifting your spirits before you drift off into that deep, dreamless sleep.

The buzz kicks in almost as soon as you blow out, filling your head with a lifted, joyful euphoria. This chill effect clears out all the bad juju, negative thoughts, replacing it with pure bliss and tranquility. This calm vibe's gonna roll over your entire body, leaving you fully relaxed from crown to sole, and pretty much glued to wherever you're chilling.

Because of these feels and its high 18-22% average THC level, folks often pick White Rhino to ease chronic pain, mood swings, chronic stress, anxiety, and insomnia. This bud's got a flavor that's a dope mix of sweet and spicy with a woody floral twist and a hint of earthiness when you blow out. The aroma's potent and spicy with a hashy scent that's complemented by floral herbs and a hit of black pepper.

White Rhino buds are little rounded, super tight mint green nuggets with a bunch of thin orange hairs and a frosting of tiny, icy white crystal trichomes. Growing this green is a cinch and it flourishes in both soil and hydroponic setups, although the soil brings out its flavor more. This strain gives a generous yield and can be grown in nearly any spot, making it a go-to among both streetwise and rookie weed growers.

Indoor cultivation has these average-sized plants flowering in about 8 to 10 weeks and ready for harvest. Indoor growers can anticipate yields of about 14 ounces of usable bud per plant if the growing space allows for it. For outdoor cultivation, White Rhino needs a damp climate, but not too wet. By early October, this strain will be in full bloom and ready for harvest. Expect your cannabis crop to yield up to 17 ounces of usable bud per plant. Now that's some real deal, right there.
