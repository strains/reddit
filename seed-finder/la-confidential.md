# Where to Buy the Best LA Confidential Cannabis Seeds Online

Yo, check it, we got this bomb-ass strain up in here, LA Confidential, aka "Confidential" or "LA Confidential OG." This bad girl's got some heavy indica vibes, like 95% indica to 5% sativa, ya feel me? It's that good-good, a mix of Afghani and California Indica, straight fire.

Think you're chillin' on an LA beach, that's the vibe LA Confidential's throwin' out. It's like medicine, man. This high, it's slick, it don't hit you all at once, nah, it's creeping, sneaking up on ya, filling you up with this deep calm, just easing out all the bad vibes, the racing thoughts, the aches and pains.

As this chill vibe settles, you start feelin' good, like really good, happiness starts bubbling up, making everything feel just right, like you're exactly where you're supposed to be. Your whole body's relaxed, you're feeling warm, like you're wrapped up in a blanket on the couch, might even make you a bit drowsy, y'know?

The THC level's up there, between 26-30%, so LA Confidential's perfect for easing chronic pain, insomnia, stress, and mood swings. Flavor-wise, it's got this spicy, skunky pine taste, with a little bit of earthy undertones. The smell, man, it's like walking through a pine forest, but there's this skunky smell that gets stronger the more you smoke.

Them buds, they're big and fluffy, like emerald green spades, with dark green leaves, thick orange hairs, and a frosting of white crystal trichomes. Growing LA Confidential is easy peasy, just set up a SCROG (screen of green) in soil or hydro, and keep the lower canopy clear of buds and extra leaves to keep the top-quality ganja flourishing.

This strain digs temperatures between 68-80 degrees Fahrenheit, but it can handle cooler temps with a little TLC. It can be grown indoors or outdoors, but it was bred for indoor grows 'cause it likes consistent temps and humidity. Outdoors can work too, if it's got enough sun.

Indoor growers can expect about 14 ounces of prime green per plant, with flowering taking about 6 to 8 weeks. Outdoor growers should be looking at about 16 ounces per plant, with harvest happening between late-September and mid-October. So get yourself some LA Confidential, and ride that wave of bliss, man.
