# Where to Buy the Best Godfather OG Cannabis Seeds Online

Ayyo, check it. We talkin' 'bout Godfather OG, the Don of all Kush strains, feel me? This ain't no ordinary reefer, it's got that legit rep for putting you straight on your back. You know what it is - it's that indica dominant hybrid, got that 60:40 indica to sativa ratio. And that THC? Man, it's off the hook - a solid 22-25%, ain't no joke.

Peep the lineage of this beast - a mix of Bubba Kush, L.A. Confidential, and GDP. It's got them solid, frosty buds that are a straight up pleasure to behold. They dense, frosty, and got them big ol' calyxes. Purple hairs on it are lit, and it's all covered in trichomes like winter frost.

Ain't nothing quite like the scent and flavor of the Godfather OG. It's got that piney, earthy vibe with a strong pungent undertone. Hits you hard and fast, the high is something else - can't even put it in words, you feel me? If you ain't careful, it'll put you down for the count.

The Don here is a good look for folks dealing with some serious medical stuff - insomnia, anxiety, depression, chronic pain and whatnot. Ain't nothing it can't handle. The Godfather OG plant itself is a sight to see, with them forest green buds and purple pistils popping off. It's got hints of blues and purples in the leaves too.

Like most OG strains, it ain't too tall, perfect for that SCROG grow method. If you keep it real, you'll get a solid yield out of this bad girl. The Don here ain't afraid of no mold, and it's got some dense nugs that'll make your eyes water.

Just watch the humidity though, can't let it get too high. You gotta take care of it, water it, feed it, top it off when it needs it. When it's time to harvest, you'll be seeing those trichome-laden nugs, rich in THC.

Godfather OG Kush plants like that cool Mediterranean vibe. They like warm summers, cool winters, and a little rain. The Don likes it dry, so keep an eye on that humidity. If you keep it dry, you might see a shorter flowering time. You can grow this bad girl indoors, outdoors, or in a greenhouse. Just keep the temp consistent, and avoid extremes.

The Don ain't too big, so it'll do well indoors, in a greenhouse, and outdoors. It's down with the SOG and SCROG techniques. Indoors, it'll give you a solid 12 to 20 oz per plant. It'll get to about 2.3ft to 3.5ft high indoors, and flower in about 7 to 9 weeks. Drier climates might see a shorter flowering period.

Outdoor Godfather OG flowering time is 10 to 12 weeks. If you're in the Northern hemisphere, you'll be harvesting from late September to early October. In the Southern hemisphere, it'll be ready between March and April. Outdoors, it'll get up to about 6.5ft high, and give you a yield of 16-23 oz per plant. Now that's what I call a Don deal, you feel me?
